In Postnet we have 5 convolution layers which is comprised of 512 filters with shape 5 Ã— 1 this is a large neural networks and can potentially overfit the data and result in poor performance so we used **drop out** at the end of each layer, Dropout is a regularization method that approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel
