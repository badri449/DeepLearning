In the postnet we have 5 convolution layers which is comprised of 512 filters with shape 5 Ã— 1.

We decreased the parameters by using 4 convolution layers of 256 filters with kernel size 3 in the file https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/blob/c410bc58ef3bd07b72ab05d29bbdc2a6df47afea/TTS/tts/layers/tacotron/tacotron2.py.
